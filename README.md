## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sudo-Harshk/skillify-frontend.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

### `npm run predeploy`
This script runs automatically before `deploy`. It ensures the project is built before deployment.
```sh
npm run build
```

### `npm run deploy`
Deploys the application to GitHub Pages.
```sh
gh-pages -d build
```

## Backend

Skillify utilizes an external backend service to fetch subject chapters and generate quiz questions.

*   **Backend API Endpoint:** `https://skillify-backend.vercel.app`

This service is responsible for providing the educational content that powers the quizzes.
